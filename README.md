# GD-PDF-CS

This is a simplified wrapper of [UglyToad/PdfPig](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig), used to extract text with associated attributes like font name, font size, and position on the page.


This is a submodule for a larger project, and will be limited in scope. If you need to extract images for example, that is not exposed (currently).

PDF export support will be added later.
